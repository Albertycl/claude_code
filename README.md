# Content Creation Workflow

## Overview
This is a structured content creation system designed to ensure consistency and quality in all content output.

## Folder Structure

### `/ideas/`
- Contains simple text files with raw ideas
- Any type of file format for brainstorming
- Starting point for all content creation

### `/examples/`
- High-quality example content that demonstrates desired style and tone
- Reference materials for maintaining consistency
- Templates and benchmarks for quality standards

### `/final_drafts/`
- Polished, completed content ready for publication
- Final output that combines ideas with example styling

## Content Creation Process

**IMPORTANT: Read this README every time you're asked to create content**

1. **Start with Ideas**: Review the relevant idea file in `/ideas/`
2. **Study Examples**: Examine files in `/examples/` to understand the desired style, tone, and format
3. **Research**: Conduct any necessary research to enhance the idea
4. **Create Final Draft**: Produce content in `/final_drafts/` that:
   - Addresses the core idea
   - Matches the style and tone of examples
   - Maintains high quality and consistency
   - Incorporates relevant research

## Consistency Guidelines
- Always reference examples before creating content
- Match the writing style, tone, and format of provided examples
- Ensure all content meets the quality standards demonstrated in examples
- Keep the user's voice and preferences consistent across all content

This workflow ensures that every piece of content created follows the established style and maintains quality standards.
